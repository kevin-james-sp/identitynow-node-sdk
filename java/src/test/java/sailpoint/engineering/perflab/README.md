This package contains performance tests written by SailPoint engineering.

These are not necessarily regression tests, but more 1-off projects that support
burn-in or specific debugging of singular issues testing.

This package may not be permanent!  We might move these bits over to the AutoHelm
repositort in future patches.  But for now these live here because it is the path
of least resistance to getting the test drivers working.
