This package contains SailPoint internal configuration files and settings.
These resources are things like the credentials to internal organizations
and regression test orgs and pods.  When/If this module is released as a
public facing repository this package must be excluded for security purposes.

KEEP THIS IN THE src/test/* PACKAGE SO IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN DELIVERED .jar!
